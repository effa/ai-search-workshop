Backup of scripts and a desktop icon for deployment at FI.
Before the workshop, the install script needs to be called once
(on any computer, because home directories are shared).

For some technical reasons (related to shared home directories),
participants must open a web browser using a desktop icon,
that's why we call jupyter notebook in the run script with `--no-browser`
option.
